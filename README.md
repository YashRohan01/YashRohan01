# Hi, I'm Yash Rohan 👋  
Researcher | ML & DL Enthusiast | Developer |  Agentic AI Pipelines   

I'm a Associate Data Scientist and I love building **AI-driven systems & solutions**.

My main aim from my GitHub profile is helping others by making a set of decsive good projects and will hopefully inspire others to do the same.

Currently exploring the frontier of **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Agentic AI**, focusing on autonomous reasoning, adaptive learning, and decision-making architectures.  

📚 Deeply engaged in **mathematical research**, particularly in:  
- **Riemann Zeta Function** and analytic number theory  
- **Time Series Analysis** for predictive intelligence  
- **Linear Algebra** foundations for robust AI models  

🧠 Research Interests:
- Robustness in ML models against adversarial attacks  
- Time Series Analysis in the domain of healthcare
- Generative AI and reasoning-driven systems  
- Emotion recognition & recommendation frameworks  

💻 Tech Stack:
`Python` · `SQL` · `Node.js`  · `JavaScript` · `HTML/CSS` · `Hadoop` · `Spark`

📊 Data & ML Tools:
`NumPy` · `Pandas` · `Scikit-learn` · `PyTorch` · `TensorFlow` · `Keras` · `Matplotlib`

🎯 Motto: *“Building, breaking, and rebuilding”*
